% function [phi psi] = psi_phi(h,t)

% N-point Gauss-Legendre rule (Numerical Recipes in Fortran 77 (1992), 18.1

%
% INPUT
% h     dimensionless source depth
% t     dummy variable vector (value between 0 and 1; length(t) = M)
%
% OUTPUT
% phi and psi are expressions from Appendix A of Fialko et al (2001), 
% equation (A1). phi and psi are used in the definition of the functions 
% PHI and PSI. See also A_B.m and Fialko et al (2001), eq. (26), p. 184.
% t and w are the abscissas and weights from the Gauss-Legendre quadrature
% rule
