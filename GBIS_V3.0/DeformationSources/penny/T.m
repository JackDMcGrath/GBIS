function [T1 T2 T3 T4] = T(h,t,r)
% INPUT
%
% h     dimensionless source depth
% r     dummy variable (used to integrate along the sill dimenionless radius) 
% t     dummy variable
%
% OUTPUT
% T1-T4 are expressions from Appendix A of Fialko et al (2001), equations 
% (A2) - (A5). T1-T4 are used in the definition of the functions phi and 
% psi (see phi_psi.m)
